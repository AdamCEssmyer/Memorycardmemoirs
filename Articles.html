  Picture this: It's late Fall of 1997. 
  You're 8 years old, It's Friday night, and your mom just took you and your brother to your small town's local video store to pick out a movie and game to rent for the weekend. 
  You walk into the store, that weird carpet smell hits your nostrils, and you see the rows and rows of VHS movies. 
  You head to the side wall where all the games are. It's sensory overload as you browse each shelf, looking at the back of the game boxes, trying to figure out what game to play on your fairly new Nintendo 64. 
  You've got a couple picked out, but then you see it. A larger box sits on the shelf; the cover art has a slick looking ship in space, a cool looking fox guy in the cockpit, and explosions all around. 
  The back shows screenshots of a ship flying around different environments, shooting at wild looking enemy ships, and also one screenshot that looks like a TANK?  
  And also, what's with this Rumble Pak? You get home, and slap the game into your N64, as well as the odd piece of plastic into the bottom of your controller.
