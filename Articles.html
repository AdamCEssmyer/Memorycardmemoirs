A fox. A falcon. A frog.  A rabbit. Spaceships. Barrel rolls. Bombs.  If you're familiar with these terms, you know where I'm headed. Starfox is one of Nintendo's most beloved franchises, though in recent years has been neglected, for reasons that we can speculate on later. But in this first episode of Memory Card Memoirs, we're going to take a look at my personal favorite in the series, Starfox 64. We'll be examining it's history and development, it's gameplay and story, and my nostalgia and own history with the game. And just as a side note- If you happened to stumble upon this video, thank you for giving it a chance, and your willingness to sit and listen to another 30 something year old man-child talk about video games on the internet. Now let's roll into Starfox 64.  (See what I did there.)
